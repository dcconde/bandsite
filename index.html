                <p class="section__paragpraph-body">The Bees Knees is a pop rock band 
                    originating from San Francisco, California. 
                    The band consists a dynamic lineup 
                    featuring two lead vocalists, two guitarists, 
                    a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer. 
                    
                    The band achieved its first commercial 
                    success as an unsigned act, drawing 
                    attention from their future manager. Having 
                    extensive experience working with both 
                    new and seasoned acts, the manager was 
                    confident the band could succeed even 
                    further with more support, pushing The 
                    Bees Knees to sign with a well known 
                    record label.
                    From there, the band has soared, gaining 
                    international recognition and ranking in the 
                    top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans 
                    immediately fell in love with the band’s 
                    original and organic attitude, solidifying 
                    their place as one of the hottest and fastest 
                    up and coming acts of this century. Fans 
                    affectionately refer to themselves as “The 
                    Hive” and are drawn to their candid and 
                    authentic performances on stage. Looking 
                    forward to touring in the future, The Bees 
                    Knees are currently recording their second 
                    studio album, looking to be released in 
                    early 2024.</p>
